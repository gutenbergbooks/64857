<p class="tb">The old grist mill and the covered bridge are links with
America&rsquo;s past which, even today, have not passed entirely from
the scene. Each was a part of the fabric of our young and growing
nation and each made its own contribution to our progress.</p>
<p>By today&rsquo;s standards, the old grist mill, driven by water-power and
with everything except its grinding stones made of wood, is somewhat
primitive. Yet even today, one must admire the fine craftsmanship with
which the water wheels and the various wheels and shafts which transmitted
the power were fashioned.</p>
<p>The old mills, and particularly the grist mill, marched with the pioneer
who wrested the wilderness from savage beast and Indian. It is
debatable whether the grist mill or the saw mill had priority in our
productive history. But it is altogether likely that the grist mill came first
in construction, with the meeting house a close second. The Bible and
the plow, and sometimes the rifle, always advanced together. &ldquo;To mill
and to meeting&rdquo; was an old-time admonition.</p>
<p>The covered bridge, battered by time and tempest, is bound up in
history and geared to the march of events. Washington and his men
clattered over many a covered bridge. The floors of scores of them resounded
with the hoof-beats of the caravans that moved westward and
southward to bring the invigorating breath of civilization to virgin areas.
Those that survive are mute reminders of a unique craftsmanship and
the sturdy qualities of our early builders.</p>
<p>The grist mill represents a pioneer American industry with a charm
and picturesqueness all its own. We are so absorbed in the tumult of
mass output that we scarcely realize the part played by the old mills in
rearing the cornerstone of our vast industrial activity. The phrase,
&ldquo;horse power,&rdquo; now geared to myriad millions of units, in all likelihood,
began with the horse-operated grist mill. A horse provided the power.
The creaking water wheels with their rhythmic splash, were the outposts
of the hydroelectric age which has harnessed rivers and falls and
wrought marvels of production the world over.</p>

<p class="pcap">Old Mills, quite a few of which are still in existence, are picturesque reminders
of an earlier day and favorite subjects for artists. This is particularly true where
the mills were built of stone as was frequently the practice in the eastern part
of the country. A limited number of these mills still operate and find a market for
their product because many people believe that meal ground between the old-style
millstones has a superior quality.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="sf">The Old Grist Mill</span></span></h2>
<p>In the early days of the seventeenth century countless little mills buzzed
busily throughout the inhabited part of this country, supplying many of
the things essential to the life of the colonists. They were operated by
hand power, animal power, and wind and water power. Sometimes the
water power was furnished by tides. It is interesting to note that, in their
primitive way, they projected the mechanical principles used in present-day
industry. The staff, post, wheel, crude pulley, wedge, inclined plane,
and screw were all in use. Those pioneers builded well, little dreaming
of the wonders that would be unfolded by the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The grist mill represents a striking evolution in the process of satisfying
the hunger of man. The Indians pounded corn in a hollowed rock
which was a crude mortar. Peasants all over the globe performed the
same kind of service to obtain flour from wheat. It was the earliest
hand power era. The Puritans, Cavaliers and Pilgrims probably obtained
their first grist in this way. They were familiar with the use of grinding
stones in Europe, so it was not long before the grist mill sprang up in
the first clearings. As a matter of fact, some of the first millstones in
this country were imported from England and France. The first mills
were operated by hand or horse power. Then came the familiar water
wheels. One of the characteristic features of the old grist mill was its
picturesque location.</p>
<p>The old grist mill was a sort of community center for the people of
the adjacent countryside. The &ldquo;jolly miller&rdquo;, as he has been designated
in song and story, like the New England tavern keeper of the Concord
coach days, was an important personage. He was a friend and philosopher
to all and sundry. His mill, which he often built with his own
hands, was a rallying place&mdash;a social rendezvous. Here news was gathered
and gossip garnered and spread. The mill had a social value akin
to that of the old country store with its potbellied stove and cracker
barrel. Over this informal country club presided the &ldquo;jolly miller.&rdquo;
Many poets have sung of his virtues.</p>
<p>Many of the old millers were artisans of the highest skill, full brothers
to the builders of the covered bridges, whose craftsmanship perished
with them. One of them was Oliver Evans, a noted millwright who lived
in Pennsylvania in the late 1700&rsquo;s. He introduced various innovations.
One of them was a tiny elevator with metal cups to carry ground grain
from the stones to the bins for storage. Before the advent of these elevators
the newly ground meal was ladled out of the pile beneath the millstones
with great wooden shovels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="766" />
<p class="pcap">This interior view of the Old Mill in Carillon Park shows the mechanism by which power
was transmitted from the water wheel to the grinding stone.</p>
</div>
<p>The grist mills were usually run by water wheels. These were made
up of two immense wheels on the same shaft with spokes of heavy flat
boards mortised to fit close together at the hub and joined together at
the rim by paddles, floats, or palettes of heavy wood which made an
endless, revolving stairway. Some wheels had compartments on each
float, the better to catch the water. The overshot wheel required a dam
and was turned by the weight of the water which fell on it from above.</p>
<p>The wheel was located wherever the dam or flume was placed. Usually
it was exposed to the weather but sometimes it rested under a shed
or penthouse. The wheel pit was a danger hole. If a man fell into it
while the wheel was turning he had little chance of escape. Millers
were known to have been drowned in their own mills when someone
opened the water gate at the wrong time.</p>
<p>There were two kinds of mills&mdash;the water wheel construction and the
tub mill. A tub mill was the simplest and cheapest of all types of grist
mill. In it the wheel was located down in a pit or &ldquo;tub&rdquo; and lay horizontally
with a vertical axle, whereas the water wheel type was a wheel
rotating on a vertical plane and mounted on a horizontal axis. One of
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
the first mills hereabouts was a tub mill built by Daniel C. Cooper
where The National Cash Register Company lumber yard now stands.</p>
<p>The millstones were fashioned out of material usually common to the
locality in which they were used. New Hampshire granite was widely
employed and what was called burrstone, originally imported from
France, and later discovered in Arkansas, also came into use. A sandstone
found in New York State found its way to many mills. Before
roads were opened up to the West and South, millstones for the new
settlements were broken up, carried on pack horses to their destination,
and then assembled with iron bands to hold them together.</p>
<p>In size the millstones ranged from one to two feet in thickness and
from three to seven feet in diameter. All stones were &ldquo;furrowed&rdquo;, as the
old phrase went. This meant that they were &ldquo;packed&rdquo; so as to carry the
meal from the center of the stone to the edges. Thus all the grain was
ground. The nether, or lower stone, harder of the two, was fixed,
that is, immovable. The upper stone revolved with the mill spindle and
could be raised or lowered. Each stone was pierced with an &ldquo;eye&rdquo;, a
hole through which the spindle, or shaft, ran. The grain poured through
the &ldquo;eyes.&rdquo; Due to almost constant wear the millstones had to be
&ldquo;dressed&rdquo; periodically.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="624" />
<p class="pcap">The face of each burrstone used for grinding wheat or corn consists of raised
sections (lands) and furrows (grooves). Whole grain is crushed by the action of
the lands and passes to the outside of the revolving stones through the grooves.
Below, a miller in the Loranger Grist Mill, Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Mich.,
is preparing the face of a burrstone with a special tool.</p>
</div>
<p>It is a tribute to the efficiency of the old grist mills that long after
they had been displaced by steam-driven plants, many people preferred,
and some still prefer, the product ground out by the millstones. They
maintain that the stones produce a higher grade of flour than can be
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
made by modern machine methods. So great was the demand for the
millstone-ground flour that a manufacturing firm in Indiana made a
miniature grist mill equipped with stones which was used in many private
homes and on some farms. Power was furnished by a motor, a far
cry from the old water wheel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="889" />
<p class="pcap">This picturesque mill is located just north of Dayton and is more than
100 years old. It is in operating condition.</p>
</div>
<p>In the heyday of the grist mill one further operation followed the
grinding. The grist was put through a bolting cloth which separated
the bran. Sometimes the bolting was done in a grist mill. More often
the sifting took place in what was called a bolting mill.</p>
<p>Many people who never saw or even heard of a grist mill know
about the millstones because of the popular sayings that have sprung up
around them. Everybody has heard the phrase, &ldquo;he is caught between
the upper and nether millstones,&rdquo; which signifies that the person referred
to is in a jam. Another phrase is, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all grist that comes to his
mill,&rdquo; meaning that the individual gets all the breaks and capitalizes
every advantage. Then too, there is the phrase, &ldquo;run of the mill,&rdquo; which
has become synonymous with routine product or performance, and &ldquo;he
has a millstone &rsquo;round his neck.&rdquo; Perhaps the best known of all is the
saying, &ldquo;The mills of the gods grind slowly yet they grind exceeding
fine.&rdquo; Many a man has had this hurled at him when his sins of omission
or commission have eventually overtaken him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The toll for having grain ground in a grist mill was usually paid in
kind. In the pioneer days the fee for grinding was four quarts out of
each bushel. Later this was reduced to two quarts. Some millers received
one-sixth of the grain they ground. Millers also kept what was called
the &ldquo;mill ring.&rdquo; This was the grist that remained around the stones
after the grinding was finished. No wonder the old millers waxed fat,
not only in girth but in worldly goods as well.</p>
<p>Although battered by time and outdistanced in the march of progress,
many grist mills still stand as a link between the slow sedate era of
American production and these humming times of swift and continuous
output. The Stony Brook Mill at Stony Brook, Long Island, is an example
of how the old mills endure. Built in 1699, it is still doing business
in the same quaint stone structure that housed it at birth.</p>
<p>Grist mills are closely associated with the early history of Dayton
and its pioneer personalities. The site of Dayton was purchased in 1795
by a group of Revolutionary soldiers seeking new homesites. It was
laid out as a town the same year by Israel Ludlow and Daniel C.
Cooper, and named in honor of Jonathan Dayton, a soldier in the War
of Independence, who later became a United States Senator from New
Jersey. Dayton was incorporated as a town in the year 1805.</p>

<p class="pcap">An old water wheel near Dayton, long since retired from active service but still
in position. The millstone in the foreground was probably brought here on pack
horses for its sections are bound together with iron bonds.</p>
</div>
<p>In those early days, manufacturing in the Miami Valley was limited.
Here, as elsewhere throughout the country, the stone block for crushing
corn was succeeded by the hand mill which, in turn, was superseded
by a mill operated by horse power. The next step was the change to
water power which brought the water wheel into use.</p>
<p>The first mills immediately around Dayton were built by Cooper
who at one time owned most of the downtown district. He set up the
first mills within the limits of Dayton proper at the head of Mill Street.
The street received its name in 1795 because of the ease with which
mills could be located there.</p>
<p>About 1798 Cooper moved to a 322-acre farm located south of
Dayton where he built a grist mill. It was known as Rubicon Farm.
Through subsequent events it became bound up in the history of
Dayton. It was bought by Col. Robert Patterson and later became the
site of the NCR plant, as well as Old River Recreational Park and the
adjacent lands.</p>
<p>Patterson was not only an able soldier and a doughty woodsman, but
something of a statesman as well. He founded in Kentucky what is
today the city of Lexington, heart of the famed bluegrass country. One
of the early governors referred to him as &ldquo;one of the earliest, bravest,
and best of the pioneers and heroes who made the Great West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once in Dayton, Colonel Patterson impressed his personality upon the
town. He owned a grist mill, a fulling mill, a saw mill, and a double
carding machine. All these were located on the Rubicon Farm. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
were at their best around 1809. In October 1815, while in full operation,
all the mills were destroyed by fire. Always resourceful, Patterson recovered
quickly from the blow. He built a grist mill known as &ldquo;The
Stone Mill&rdquo; which became a Dayton landmark. It was located on the
Brown Street road where the Rubicon crossed it. Stonemill Road takes
its name from this fact.</p>
<p>Rubicon Farm was destined to be linked with the drama of American
industry. Colonel Patterson had ten children, the youngest of whom was
Jefferson. He succeeded to ownership of part of the estate and the
mills. Here on December 13, 1844, his son, John H. Patterson, founder
of The National Cash Register Company and a notable figure in
industrial development, was born and spent his boyhood, serving a hardy
apprenticeship in work.</p>
<p>As the years sped on, Dayton and vicinity became an important milling
center. By the winter of 1822-23 there were fifty grist mills along
the Miami River. Montgomery County, alone, had eleven grist mills.</p>
<p>While some of the old grist mills still perform their time-honored task
to the music of purling mill streams, the vast majority have vanished, or
stand as crumbling landmarks of another generation. Yet in their day
they were indispensable to life and labor. The memory of them will
always be as green as the moss that clung to the dripping paddles of the
great water wheels.</p>

</div>
<p>Like many other supplanted or vanishing features of early American
life, the covered bridge is enshrined in song, legend and story. It has
been a prize subject for etchers and painters. Innumerable post cards
bearing the picture of some famous bridge crowd the mail pouches,
especially in the New England States.</p>
<p>Just as the railroad sounded the doom of the Conestoga wagon, the
Concord coach and the narrow inland canal, so did the automobile end
the larger era of the covered bridge. The motorist wanted a steel, iron
or concrete ground-hold for his car when he dashed across a river. Although
the old bridges were built for good, solid wear, and sometimes
a lot of tear as well, they could not stand up against the speedster. They
were built for slow traffic. In the old days, teams were obliged to proceed
at a walk, under penalty of a fine ranging from $2.00 to $5.00. The
motor car, however, had stout allies in bridge destruction in fire, flood,
and changes in highway routes. Many of the oldest and best known of
the covered bridges were destroyed by fire or high water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Although the covered bridge, as we know it, is distinctly an American
institution, it did not originate in this country. There is a record of a
roofed bridge built over the Euphrates in Babylon in 783 B.C. The
Tiber at Rome was crossed by several covered bridges. The best known
structure of this type in Europe is across an arm of Lake Lucerne in
Switzerland. It has a steep, arched roof, is built entirely of timber, and
is used only by pedestrians.</p>
<p>The covered bridge in this country underwent no evolution such as
was the case with the great girder and suspension structures that span
our big rivers. It began with a simple pattern and followed that pattern
with few changes. The origin is interesting. In the early days when our
civilization was young, the ferry was the traditional method of crossing
a river. It was slow, cumbersome and inadequate. The farmer who
wanted to drive a flock of sheep or a herd of cattle to the market
found it difficult. Then began the era of open wooden bridges. The
log pilings soon became subject to rapid decay and to destruction by
floods and ice floes. Stone piers then replaced the wooden pilings, but
these did not prevent the bridge floor from rotting under attacks of the
weather. To meet this situation a shed was built over the floor. Soon
the shed had sides. Before long there was a path for pedestrians. In this
way the covered bridge came into being.</p>
<p>For years there has been a difference of opinion as to why the old
bridges were covered. Some have maintained that it was to prevent the
horses from shying at the water. Others have contended that the roof
was built to protect the driver, while still others believed that the bridges
were roofed to provide a refuge from storms. The basic reason was to
protect the floor from the elements.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="497" />
<p class="pcap">Covered bridges were part of the Dayton scene until the early 1900&rsquo;s. This bridge
spanned the Miami River at Third Street. It was built in 1839 and razed in 1903.
Another covered bridge crossed the river at Main Street, and another on the site of
the present Dayton View bridge.</p>

</div>
<p>Most covered bridges were built along identical lines. They usually
had a single tunnel with sides boarded to the eaves. The two-tunnel
bridge was something of an exception. One of the few changes in bridge
construction came with latticed sides which relieved the bridge from
the gloom that pervaded the original type. This gloom had its compensation
for lovers, who found freedom from prying eyes in the friendly
dark. More than one old structure was called &ldquo;The Kissing Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original bridges with the planked sides afforded a great opportunity
for the billposter. The walls blazed with lurid circus posters,
advertisements for patent medicines and brands of tobacco. It represented
the first phase of what has come to be known as &ldquo;outdoor
advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The covered bridge also afforded an opportunity for robbers to ply
their trade. It was easy to hide in the deep shadows, pounce upon
the unsuspecting wayfarer, and despoil him of his possessions. Murderers
also lurked in those dark confines. Crimes on the covered bridges were
numerous. This led a contemporary writer to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys have lost a year&rsquo;s growth by going through a covered bridge;
girls have become gray before their time; stout farmers have had a
queer feeling when the moon is high, the roads deserted, and the echoes
of the horses&rsquo; hoofs are loud and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two main types of covered bridges were the lattice truss of wood
and the Howe truss of iron and wood.</p>
<p>One outstanding fact in connection with the old bridges is that they
were not built by engineers or professional bridge-builders, but by local
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
carpenters who put up the houses and barns in the adjacent countryside.
This explains what has been termed their &ldquo;homely simplicity.&rdquo; They
represented honest work. Those men had no knowledge of scientific
building. Wind pressure and load limit were the first considerations.
One builder constructed his bridges &ldquo;high and wide as a load of hay.&rdquo;
That was his only specification.</p>
<p>In commenting on the work of those covered bridge builders, a well-known
engineer wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those early builders knew nothing of the theory of stresses; indeed
many of them did not even call themselves engineers, but the long and
honorable service of the structures they built, under loads far greater
than the builders could have foreseen, is a striking testimonial to the
excellence of the materials and the skilled workmanship that went into
their construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second striking fact in connection with the bridges is that the abutments
were piled stone. The structure was held together by pegs of hard
wood. No mortar, cement, bolts, or nails were used. The marvel is that
so many of them have stood up for more than a century. In their way
they were masterpieces of construction.</p>
<p>A third feature of interest is that while most of the old bridges followed
the same lines of construction, no two were precisely alike.
Many writers have emphasized the fact that each bridge has a certain
individuality. Nor was this individuality lacking in attractiveness. Some
of the structures were architecturally beautiful with an old-time charm.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="515" />
<p class="pcap">On many a covered bridge
it was a long way through and the trip was much more
pleasant in the daytime than at night.</p>
</div>
<p>Crude as were the methods and materials employed, the old bridge
builders left monuments to their skill. The bridge across the Schuylkill
River near Philadelphia, built in 1813, had a span of 340 feet in length.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
When constructed, it was the longest span in the world. Another long
bridge was at Charlemont, across the Deerfield River near the scene
of the famous massacre of settlers by Indians in the early New England
days. It was 324 feet long.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="592" />
<p class="pcap">There were many different types of covered bridges. This one was built with two
lanes, although speeding traffic was much less of a problem in its day than now.</p>
</div>
<p>The covered bridges cost from $300 to $6,500. They were built
by towns, individuals and companies. Often a lottery provided the cost
of construction.</p>
<p>As on the old turnpikes, toll was charged on many of the bridges. The
rate for a foot passenger was two cents; for a cow, two cents; one sheep,
one-half cent; a horse, four cents; horse and rider, six cents; cart, sleigh,
sled, or wagon and one horse, ten cents; two horses, thirteen cents;
wood per cord, fifteen cents; all other loads with one horse, ten cents.</p>
<p>Most of the private companies operating covered bridges fared exceedingly
well. Some bridges paid as high as 18 to 20 per cent a year.</p>
<p>The exaction of tolls created bitter opposition in many communities
and became an issue in politics. The Lyman covered bridge between
Hartford, Vermont, and Lebanon, New Hampshire, completed in 1804,
was known as the &ldquo;Inter-State Hold-Up&rdquo; because the tolls were so exorbitant.
Even ministers were forced to pay to cross the bridge.</p>
<p>So deep-seated was the unrest over toll charges that in many instances
the tolls were withdrawn. The first free covered bridge across the
Connecticut River, where the earliest of the bridges was built, was
opened to the public in 1859. This bridge, which spanned the river between
Norwich, Vermont, and Hanover, New Hampshire, was built by
the two towns at a cost of $6,500. It was 400 feet long and stood 40 feet
at low water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The classic covered bridge story and the perennial delight of all
writers on the subject deals with a farmer who drove up to a long
bridge with a load of hay on the way to market. He stopped at the
entrance and squinted down the dark tunnel. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can git through this end all right, but there ain&rsquo;t room to squeeze
through that little hole at the other end.&rdquo; With this remark he turned
his team and drove back home, his hay unsold.</p>
<p>Another anecdote is connected with the &ldquo;Walk Your Horses&rdquo; sign at
the entrance of the Hartford covered bridge. A woman was summoned
to court for disobeying this injunction. She hired a clever lawyer and
contested the case. When it was called in court the lawyer said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, the law reads that a fine be imposed on any man who
drives a horse across the bridge faster than a walk. I move that this
case be thrown out. My client is a woman and she was driving a mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case was dismissed.</p>
<p>The covered bridge served purposes for which it was not originally
intended. On wet nights it became a sort of informal community center.
Preachers, on occasion, used it for camp meetings. The local militia
drilled in it. Once a school teacher, whose little red schoolhouse
burned down, held some of her classes under its shingled roof.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="459" />
<p class="pcap">The view from the Dayton Art Institute is one of the finest in the city, but it has changed
materially over the years, as is evidenced by this drawing made in the 1840s. The covered
bridge, standing on the present site of the Dayton View bridge, was part of the scene when
this sketch was made.</p>
</div>
<p>The story of the covered bridge is not altogether a narrative of the
past. No one knows accurately just how many were standing at the peak
of their use. One thing, however, is certain. There was a time when the
entire New England countryside and a considerable portion of the rest
of the country, was dotted with covered bridges. They crossed streams
in twenty-six states. One reason why they were so widespread lay in
the fact that when New Englanders, the first builders, moved west or
south, they constructed the same type of bridge that they had known
and found satisfactory back home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1349" />
<p class="pcap">The walls of covered bridges lent themselves only too well to the activities of the bill
poster. Such posters as these extolled the virtues of the products they promoted in the
days of the covered bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>One of the most zealous of the covered bridge historians has computed
that there are still 2,000 of the old structures intact and still in
use. Ohio ranks first with 592 bridges and Pennsylvania next with 336.
Indiana has 202. Vermont with 200, has more covered bridges than all
the other New England States combined. Massachusetts, where many of
the earlier bridges were built, today has 26, while Connecticut is at the
bottom of the list with only 7.</p>
<p>Of the 2,000 bridges still standing, many have unique names and
associations. The second Lyman bridge, which replaced the &ldquo;Inter-State
Hold-Up,&rdquo; was called the &ldquo;Bridge of Spooks.&rdquo; It was dimly lighted at night
by swinging kerosene lamps. Children avoided it after sunset and grownups
went through in a hurry.</p>
<p>One of the oldest and most noted of the covered bridges is Esperance
bridge on the famous Mohawk Valley Turnpike on which all stagecoach
traffic in and out of Albany, New York, traveled. The first bridge
on this site was built in 1793 and was destroyed by a freshet. The
present structure went up in 1811, the second to be erected by the State
of New York. No covered bridge ever earned more money. The tolls by
1846 amounted to $1,000,000. More than 700 teams crossed in a single
day. In view of its long and fruitful history New York has preserved
the bridge as a state monument.</p>
<p>Most of the covered bridges are gone but they are not forgotten.
Their distinct place in the category of early Americana is widely
recognized. Many have become museum pieces. States and individuals
are conserving them. Henry Ford&rsquo;s collection of covered bridges at Dearborn,
Michigan, is the largest in the country. The inclusion of a covered
bridge in Carillon Park is recognition of its status in the evolution of
American life.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="429" />
<p class="pcap">This is the longest single-span covered bridge in the United States.
It is 210 feet long and is located near North Blenheim, N. Y.</p>

<p class="pcap">The diorama in the Wagon Shed depicts a scene in the Miami Valley as it might have
appeared in the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>
</div>
<p>The diorama in the Wagon Shed presents a composite picture of
some of the Carillon Park exhibits as they would have appeared in
actual use. The three-dimensional, accurately scaled model shows a
canal boat approaching a lock. Passengers sitting on the top deck are
dressed in the costumes of the day. The boat is the packet type designed
to carry passengers and representing in its day a considerable degree
of luxury in travel.</p>
<p>In the background is a covered bridge and to the left, an old mill
built beside a stream. At the right a settler&rsquo;s cabin typifies the rural
housing of the day and the settler, himself, watches the boat pass.
Traveling the road beyond the canal is a Conestoga wagon and a
Concord coach.</p>
<p>Thus, against the background of the rich countryside which made
possible the great development of the Miami Valley, are many of the
elements which contributed to the way of life of its early settlers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
